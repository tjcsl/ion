    <p><b>By the end of the summer after graduation, your TJ Network Account will be deleted.</b> However, you can configure messages sent to your TJ Email account, <b>{{ request.user.tj_email }}</b>, to forward to another address. You will not be able to log into Webmail.</p>
    <p>Consider entering your university-provided email address, and not a Gmail account that you might forget about. Once set at the conclusion of the summer, this address can't be changed.</p>
    <p>Enter the email address to forward messages sent to {{ request.user.tj_email }} after your TJ Network Account is deleted:</p>
