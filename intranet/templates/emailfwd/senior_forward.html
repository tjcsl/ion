    </h2>

    <p><b>At the conclusion of the school year, your TJ Network Account will be deleted.</b> However, you can configure messages sent to your TJ Email address, <b>{{ request.user.tj_email }}</b>, to forward to another address (such as your university email or a personal email). You will not be able to log into Webmail. Once set at the end of the school year, this address can't be changed.</p>
    <p>Do not operate under the assumption that your mail will continue to forward for extended periods of time. You should attempt to transition away from using your TJ email over the next few years.</p>
    <p>You may only add verified emails as a forward. You can add and verify emails in your <a href="{% url 'preferences' %}">user preferences</a>.</p>
    <p>Choose the email address to forward messages sent to <b>{{ request.user.tj_email }}</b> after your TJ Network Account is deleted:</p>
