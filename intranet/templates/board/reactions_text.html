        Introducing the fast new way to collaborate at TJ: <b>Ion Connect</b>
    </span><br />
    <p>
        Ion Connect was created with the dream of allowing students to communicate and collaborate with each other as effortlessly as possible. Our research team embarked on an extensive, year-long study to answer one overarching question: <b>How can students foster their desire to embark on frictionless and instantaneous methods of communication in our inherently competitive TJ environment?</b> The answer, of course, was simple: <b>internet memes</b>, the societal backbone of 21st century Internet users. And, as an equally important component in today's social media-driven world, the ability to effortlessly communicate your opinions through <b>emoji</b>. By combining modern society's two most vital constructs, we are proud to have truly created a social media platform for the modern age, exclusively available through the TJ Intranet.
