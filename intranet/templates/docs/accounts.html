If you graduate in 2023 and your name is Alice Longestlastnameintheworld, your TJ username is <i>2023alongest</i>.</p>
    <p>If someone else shares the first initial and first seven letters of the last name, a sequential number will be added based on the student's placement in alphabetic order. For the purposes of this username, all dashes and spaces in your first and last names are ignored.</p>
    <p>If you login to <a href="https://resetter.tjhsst.edu">https://resetter.tjhsst.edu</a> with your FCPS Google Apps for Education account, it will display your TJ username in the first line.</p>
