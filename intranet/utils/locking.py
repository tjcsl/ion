    """Given an iterable of ``Model`` instances, ``Manager``s, and/or ``QuerySet``s, locks the
    corresponding database rows.

    More specifically, this uses the Django ORM's ``select_for_update()`` method, which translates
    to a ``SELECT FOR UPDATE`` SQL query. For more information on what this actually does in
    PostgreSQL (used as the database backend in all environments) see PostgreSQL's
    documentation on locking at
    https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html#LOCKING-ROWS.

    As described in Django's documentation at
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/queryset/#django.db.models.query.QuerySet.select_for_update,
    the ``select_for_update`` locks prevent other transactions from acquiring locks until
    this transaction is complete.

    This MUST by run in a transaction. A straightforward way to do this is to use the
    ``django.db.transaction.atomic`` wrapper.

    Args:
        items: An iterable of ``Model`` instances, ``Manager``s, and/or ``QuerySet``s representing
            the database rows to lock.
