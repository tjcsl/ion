        here when they are first accessed, and not on creation or edit,

        This presents some complications. All model-level relationships for
        a group should use the *Django contrib.auth.models.Group object*, and
        not the custom one defined here. You will see this done, to avoid
        confusion, like:

            from django.contrib.auth.models import Group as DjangoGroup

        with DjangoGroup being referenced in the OneToOne or ManyToMany relationship.
