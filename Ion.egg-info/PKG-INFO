        Version 3.0.0
        
        Intranet3 (Ion) is the next-generation Intranet platform for `TJHSST 
        <https://www.tjhsst.edu/>`_. Using Python, Django, Redis, Postgres, and many other technologies, Ion was developed from the ground up to be simple, well-documented, and extensible.
        
        Documentation (in RestructuredText format) is available inside the "docs" folder or at https://ion.readthedocs.org/ publicly on the web.
        
        **What does the TJ Intranet do?** Ion allows students, teachers, and staff at TJHSST to access student information, manage activity signups, and view information on news and events. `Read more about how Ion is used at Thomas Jefferson <https://ion.tjhsst.edu/about>`_.
        
        **Ion now requires Python 3.4+** Python 3.4 is currently used in both production and testing environments. If you already have a Vagrant environment set up with Python 2, re-run ``config/provision_vagrant.sh`` to update dependencies.
        
        **How can I create a testing environment?** Read the section on `Setting up Vagrant <https://ion.readthedocs.org/en/latest/setup/vagrant.html>`_ in the documentation. Ask a TJ Sysadmin for VPN access and tokens needed to connect to our servers.
        
        **Why is my build failing?** A PEP 8 syntax checker is run during the CI build. You can add a pre-commit hook to warn you about issues in your code by running ``flake8 --install-hook``.
        Ensure that your code follows those guidelines by running this in the root of the repository: ``./scripts/format.sh``
        
        **Where can I report a bug?**
        
        * Most bugs and feature requests should be submitted through `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/tjcsl/ion/issues>`_.
        * Security-related or TJ CSL-specific issues should be submitted on `Bugzilla <http://bugs.tjhsst.edu/>`_ or emailed to `intranet@tjhsst.edu <mailto:intranet@tjhsst.edu>`_.
