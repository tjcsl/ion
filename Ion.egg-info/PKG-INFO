        *Version 3.0.0*
        
        Intranet3 (Ion) is the next-generation Intranet platform for `TJHSST 
        <https://www.tjhsst.edu/>`_. Using Python, Django, Redis, Postgres, and many other technologies, Ion was developed from the ground up to be simple, well-documented, and extensible.
        
        Documentation (in RestructuredText format) is available inside the "docs" folder or at https://tjcsl.github.io/ion publicly on the web.
        
        **What does the TJ Intranet do?** Ion allows students, teachers, and staff at TJHSST to access student information, manage activity signups for TJ's Eighth Period program, and view information on news and events. `Read more about how Ion is used at Thomas Jefferson <https://ion.tjhsst.edu/about>`_.
        
        **Ion now requires Python 3.6+** Python 3.6 is currently used in both production and testing environments.
        
        **How can I create a testing environment?** Read the section on `Setting up Vagrant <https://tjcsl.github.io/ion/setup/vagrant.html>`_ in the documentation.
        
        **How can I contribute to Ion? How can I report a bug? How can I report a security issue/vulnerability?**
